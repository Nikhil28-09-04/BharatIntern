        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <img src="nikhilpic1.jpeg" alt="NIKHIL TIWARI" class="profile-image" />
        <p>
          Hello, I'm a passionate and driven third-year student pursuing a
          Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering.
        </p>
        <p>
          From the outset, I've found myself deeply engrossed in the world of
          cybersecurity and web security. The ever-evolving landscape of digital
          threats and vulnerabilities has always intrigued me. As a result, I've
          made it my mission to become adept in these fields, constantly seeking
          out new challenges to enhance my knowledge and skills.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond my academic pursuits, I'm also a dedicated sports enthusiast. I
          firmly believe that physical activity is not just about staying fit
          but also about cultivating discipline, teamwork, and determination.

          <h4>Portfolio Website Project</h4>

          <p>
            The Portfolio Website Project represents my introduction to web
            development as a beginner. It showcases my evolving skills and
            achievements in a simple and elegant design, with user-friendly
            navigation for visitors to explore sections like About Me, Projects,
            and Contact Me. I used HTML to create the structure and content of
            the website and also applied CSS to style the website, making it
            visually appealing.

          <h4>Basic Keylogger</h4>

          <p>
            This project involved the development of a basic keylogger using
            Python. The keylogger I created was designed to discreetly capture
            and log keystrokes entered by a user, offering insights into user
            behavior and potential vulnerabilities. While the ethical
            implications of such software are clear, this project's primary aim
            was to deepen my knowledge of cybersecurity and develop
            countermeasures against such threats.
